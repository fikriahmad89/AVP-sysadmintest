		-MIN_THRESHOLD_SIZE 	= minimum threshold size and calculated on byte level
		-MAX_THRESHOLD_SIZE 	= maximum threshold size and calculated on byte level
		-MIN_THRESHOLD_HR	= human redable value of minimum threshold level (either xxMB, xxGB or xxTB where xx is the value)	
		-MAX_THRESHOLD_HR	= human redable value of maximum threshold level (either xxMB, xxGB or xxTB where xx is the value)
		-MONITOR_DIR		= directory to monitor for rogue files. can be specific directory or root directory depending on requirement
		-TO_EMAIL		= recipient email address for alerts. can be specific email or distribution list email. in this case alarm@animapoint.net
		-SMTP_SERVER		= external SMTP server for sending emails (as no internal email server)
		-SMTP_PORT		= SMTP server port (recommend 587 for TLS encryption)
		-SMTP_USERNAME		= external SMTP server username

		-EXTERNAL_STORAGE_URL	= location html store for audit purpose (for standby purpose just in case any audit need to be done). can be noted if not require.

2. systemd service configuration (for running the script on startup):
	- create a systemd service file at /etc/systemd/system (example: rogue-monitor.service).

		After=network.target

		[Service]
		Type=simple
		ExecStart=LOCATION OF SH SCRIPT 
		Restart=always
		User=your_username   

		[Install]
		WantedBy=multi-user.target

   	- replace 'LOCATION OF SH SCRIPT' with the actual path to the rogue.sh script.
   	- replace 'your_username' with your server login username.

3. reload, enable and start the systemd service:
	- run the following commands to reload, enable and start the service:

		sudo systemctl daemon-reload
		sudo systemctl start rogue-monitor
		sudo systemctl enable rogue-monitor

4. reboot the server to verify that the script runs on startup.
	- run the following command to check status of service after startup

		sudo systemctl status rogue-monitor
