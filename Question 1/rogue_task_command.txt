1.create the rogue.sh script
	- SSH to server and ls to user location
	- create directory to store script (mkdir script for example)
	- change directory top new location (cd script for example if follow above command)
	- create rogue.sh file (nano rogue.sh to create a file call rogue.sh on directory) 
	- paste the script on the terminal SSH.
	- exit nano and save (ctrl+X and press Y to save)

2.make the script executable
	- run chmod command (chmod +x rogue.sh)
	- this is require as script will revert error 

3.configure the script parameter
	- make sure same directory as number 1 
	- check and open the script (ls the directory and make sure rogue.sh is there, nano rogue.sh to open the file)
	- replace information as below with your specific value
		-MIN_THRESHOLD_SIZE 
		-MAX_THRESHOLD_SIZE
		-MIN_THRESHOLD_HR
		-MAX_THRESHOLD_HR
		-MONITOR_DIR
		-TO_EMAIL
		-SMTP_SERVER
		-SMTP_PORT
		-SMTP_USERNAME
		-SMTP_PASSWORD
		-FROM_EMAIL
		-EXTERNAL_STORAGE_URL
	- exit nano and save (ctrl+X and press Y to save)

4.test the script:
	- run the script manually: ./rogue.sh
	- monitor and ensure that it detects rogue files and sends alerts.
	- adjust the threshold and SMTP setting if require 

5.configure the script to run on startup
	- there are few ways to do this. 
	- best is to use systemd service as requirement is to run at startup and systemd is easier to check the status at reboot
	
	systemd service
	===============
	- cd to /etc/systemd/system. this is local configuration for system and service manager in linux
	- create a custom systemd service file example title rogue-monitor.service (example using nano by running nano rogue-monitor.service)
	- add the necessary configuration as per below.

		[Unit]
		Description=Rogue File Monitor
		After=network.target

		[Service]
		Type=simple
		ExecStart=LOCATION OF SH SCRIPT 
		#replace on location of script.sh located. can check using pwd command once change directory (cd) to correct location
		Restart=always
		User=your_username   
		#replace your_username with the username you want to run the service as

		[Install]
		WantedBy=multi-user.target


	- save the service file once configuration were created by exiting nano and save (ctrl+X and press Y to save)
	- reload systemd to apply changes

		sudo systemctl daemon-reload

	- start the service

		sudo systemctl start rogue-monitor
		#if we follow same title as per suggested above

	- enable and start the service at boot

		sudo systemctl enable rogue-monitor
		#if we follow same title as per suggested above


6.reboot the server to verify that the script runs on startup
	- check with server owner for reboot clearance
	- once clearance is go, reboot server
	- check status of script using command below

		sudo systemctl status rogue-monitor
		#if we follow same title as per suggested above
